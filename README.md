# R-s-ember

Recommendation system Frontend for Heriot Watt PG Course.

This is an open source project which i am planning to do for helping students to find the most suitable courses for their Post Graduation. Right now the project is completely focussed on Heriot Watt University, as i did my PG from there :)

However I wanted to completely automate this process for maximum number of universities all around the world.

The application is built using ember-cli. I believe Ember has the highest learning curve among most of the new Javascipt frameworks.
However by doing this in Ember, I can learn the same and can also contribute to open source community.
